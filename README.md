## üõ°Ô∏è About PrivacyGnine

PrivacyGnine is a privacy-focused image processing application that runs entirely in your browser. It allows you to anonymize photos by selectively blurring or hiding sensitive areas using multiple shape tools. All processing happens locally on your device - no data ever leaves your computer.

- **Color-Preserving Blur**: Apply a natural-looking blur that maintains the original image colors
- **Complete Hide Option**: Fully obscure sensitive information when needed
- **Adjustable Privacy Levels**: Fine-tune the intensity of privacy filters
- **Feathered Edges**: Create smooth transitions between original and processed areas
- **Client-Side Processing**: All image processing happens in your browser using TensorFlow.js
- **Touch-Friendly Interface**: Works seamlessly on mobile devices and tablets
- **Download Results**: Save your anonymized images for sharing or publishing
